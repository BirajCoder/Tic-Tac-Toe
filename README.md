# Tic Tac Toe Game


The project implements the basic features of tic tac toe game. With a 3-3 square box. Whenever a player wins or there is no moves left the game stops and page becomes static. Refresh the page to start a new game. All the moves are stored and we can easily undo a move. Once undo is done, we can redo the moves. 


This is my first react up and I followed the React official tutorial to build this game. While the game was mostly for learning purpose, I want to take a step ahead and implement the advanced features in this game and also add few other few additional features to it.
